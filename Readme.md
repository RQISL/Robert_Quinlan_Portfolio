## Information about my portfolio website

I purchased a beautiful website created by Rene Puchinger from Envato Market back in 2018. However, I didn't update it until 2024. I use the website to display my personal information, CV, portfolio, and photos.

Furthermore, I added PHPMailer to the contact form on my website using a tutorial from the [PHPMailer website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgyCkBgMVBc). Alternatively, you can download PHPMailer from GitHub or use terminal options. To download PHPMailer from GitHub, visit [Github PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer?tab=readme-ov-file).

You can visit my portfolio website at [Robert Quinlan's portfolio site](https://robert-quinlan-cv-b1d565eee35f.herokuapp.com/).
